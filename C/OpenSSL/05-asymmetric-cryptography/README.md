# [Exercise Title]

## Overview

Provide a brief introduction to this exercise. Explain what cryptographic concept or tool is being explored and why it is important.  
*Example:* In this exercise, you will learn how to generate cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers using OpenSSL.

## Objectives

- **Understand the Concept:** Explain the underlying cryptographic principle (e.g., PRNG, symmetric encryption).
- **Practical Implementation:** Write or analyze code that implements the concept.
- **Security Insights:** Recognize common pitfalls and best practices in cryptographic implementations.

## Exercise Details

- **Topic:** Asymmetric Encryption
- **Language:** C
- **Tools/Libraries:** OpenSSL

### Background
