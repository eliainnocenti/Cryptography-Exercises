# [Exercise Title]

## Overview

Provide a brief introduction to this exercise. Explain what cryptographic concept or tool is being explored and why it is important.  
*Example:* In this exercise, you will learn how to generate cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers using OpenSSL.

## Objectives

- **Understand the Concept:** Explain the underlying cryptographic principle (e.g., PRNG, symmetric encryption).
- **Practical Implementation:** Write or analyze code that implements the concept.
- **Security Insights:** Recognize common pitfalls and best practices in cryptographic implementations.

## Exercise Details

- **Topic:** Random Numbers
- **Language:** C
- **Tools/Libraries:** OpenSSL

### Background

Include key details extracted from the course material/slides:
- For random number generation, mention the importance of a strong seed, the use of functions like `RAND_bytes` and `RAND_priv_bytes`, and the role of PRNGs in cryptography.
- For other topics, briefly summarize the theoretical background as provided in the slides (e.g., differences between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, the significance of MACs, etc.).

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**  
   Describe how to set up the environment (compiling instructions, required libraries, etc.).
   
2. **Implementation:**
   Outline the steps to complete the exercise. Include code snippets or pseudocode as necessary.
   
3. Testing:
   Provide instructions on how to run the code and verify the output.
