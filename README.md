# Cryptography Exercises

Welcome to the Cryptography Exercises Repository â€“ a collection of challenges and exercises designed to work with cryptographic concepts and techniques. This repository contains materials for the **Cryptography** course at **Politecnico di Torino**, focusing on both implementation and attack scenarios to bridge theory and practice.

## Overview

The exercises are divided into two main parts:

- **C Programming with OpenSSL:**  
  Learn how to implement cryptographic primitives and protocols in C. Exercises include:

  - **Random Numbers:** Generating cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers.
  - **Symmetric Encryption:** Implementing and understanding symmetric ciphers.
  - **Digests & MACs:** Working with hash functions and message authentication codes.
  - **Big Numbers:** Handling large integer arithmetic for crypto applications.
  - **Asymmetric Cryptography:** Exploring public-key techniques and RSA.

- **Python for Cryptography Attacks:**  
  Focus on rapidly prototyping and executing attacks, as Python is the de facto language for quick and effective exploit development.

**Key Objectives:**

- Enhance programming skills in C and Python.
- Translate cryptographic theory into practical implementations.
- Understand both how to build secure systems and how vulnerabilities are exploited.
- Prepare for real-world CTF challenges by engaging with both offensive and defensive perspectives.

For further details, refer to the course slides and materials provided during the lectures.
