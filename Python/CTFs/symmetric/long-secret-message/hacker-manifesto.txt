This is our world now... The world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud. We make use of a service already existing without
paying for what could be dirt cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering 
gluttons, and you call us criminals. We explore... And you call us 
criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without 
religious bias... And you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, 
you wage wars, you murder, you cheat, and lie to us and try to make us 
believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.
